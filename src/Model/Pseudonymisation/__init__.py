"""Pseudonymisation of DICOM datasets for OnkoDICOM, relying only on pydicom.

Rewritten from the pseudonymisation and anonymisation in pymedphys 0.41.0
(``pymedphys._experimental.pseudonymisation`` and ``pymedphys._dicom.anonymise``).
Stuart Swerdloff, who wrote the pymedphys pseudonymisation code, agreed on
13 November 2026 to its use here under OnkoDICOM's licence.

For the same pepper and jitter, ``pseudonymise_dataset`` gives the same dataset as
``pymedphys.dicom.anonymise`` called with pymedphys's pseudonymisation strategy and
keywords, as OnkoDICOM called it before. The intended differences:

- An element is "known" if pydicom's data dictionary has it, where pymedphys used its
  own older copy of that dictionary. pydicom knows 838 more standard tags, and pymedphys
  refused a dataset containing any of them.
- The file meta is pseudonymised too. pymedphys left the original SOP Instance UID in
  ``file_meta.MediaStorageSOPInstanceUID`` of every file (#63).
- A value that is not valid for its VR (for example a date that is not a date) is
  emptied and logged as a warning; pymedphys refused the whole dataset (#61).
- Non-ASCII text is hashed (as UTF-8), and each value of a multi-valued UI is
  pseudonymised separately; pymedphys refused both.

No claim of conformance to any DICOM Application Level Confidentiality Profile is made.
